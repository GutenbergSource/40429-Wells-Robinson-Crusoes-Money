<HTML><BODY><p>After having completed this book in the Dutch translation (PG etext no <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/28525">28525</a>), I looked for the English original.

<p>This is a well written essay on the abuse of Money and Monetary Policies, which, although written in 1876 still rings very true in today's financial crisis (which by the way is far from over, although various governments on both sides of the the Atlantic are applying loads of the financial equivalent of duct tape.)

<p>Have fun! (The cartoons are great.)</BODY></HTML>
